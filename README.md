# EasyMode — All Your Assets. One Powerful Platform.

**EasyMode** is a versatile asset management platform enabling users to easily track, monitor, and maintain a wide range of assets — including vending machines, properties, vehicles, and personal items using powerful visual and scheduling tools.

This project was developed to address the common issue of asset fragmentation, where critical information is spread across spreadsheets, calendars, and disconnected systems. EasyMode centralizes asset data and scheduling within a single secure and intuitive platform, enabling individuals and small businesses to operate more efficiently.
The idea was inspired by a personal need for structured life planning, bringing clarity and control to the management of everyday responsibilities and long-term goals.
